# simple_file_comparison
A simple file comparator written in python with graphical interface.

It makes a simple comparison of the text and shows the lines with the differences as a result. 

Remember the path of the last files used. 

It uses PyQt5 for the interface, so it should work well in Linux or Windows environments.
